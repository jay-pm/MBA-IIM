Marketing is of vital importance to any business. Marketing is everything a company does to acquire customers and maintain a relationship with them. It starts with understanding consumer's preferences for products and services and attempts to satisfy their different wants and needs in a profitable manner. Your business may offer the best products or services in your industry, but without marketing, your potential customers would not know about it.
